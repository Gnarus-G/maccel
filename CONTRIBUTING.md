- Short subject line: Keep the first line (subject) brief and descriptive, aiming for under 50 characters. 
- Imperative mood: Use verbs in the present tense, like "Add", "Fix", "Update". 
- Capitalization: Capitalize the first letter of the subject line. 
- Blank line separation: Use a blank line to separate the subject from the body explanation.
