# maccel

Mouse pointer acceleration driver. A CLI tool and TUI allows you to easily edit a curve's parameters.

## Linear Acceleration Function
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a9e42195-41f9-419a-9de9-2f7ad83604aa)

$$V = \frac{\sqrt{dx_0^2 + dy_0^2}}{i}$$

$$dx_f = dx_0 * (1 + aV)$$

$$dy_f = dy_0 * (1 + aV)$$

Where $dx$ and $dy$ are the directional displacements read from the mouse,
$i$ is the polling interval of the mouse; this would be 1ms if the polling rate is 1000Hz,
and $a$ is the user provided
acceleration factor.

The more general function, which is relevant with a set input offset, is:

$$(dx_f, dy_f) = (dx_0, dy_0) * (1 + a * (V - offset_in)^2 / V)$$

## Install

### Shell Script (Recommended)
Make sure to have these dependencies installed on your machine:
`curl`, `git`, `make`, `dkms`, and the linux headers in `/lib/modules/`

You might also, and you probably don't, have to install `gcc` or `clang` 
depending on with which your distro's kernel was built.

```sh
curl -fsSL https://www.maccel.org/install.sh | sudo sh
```

If you choose to build the cli from source:
```sh
curl -fsSL https://www.maccel.org/install.sh | sudo BUILD_CLI_FROM_SOURCE=1 sh
```
You'll need [`cargo`](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

### Arch (PKGBUILD)

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Gnarus-G/maccel
cd maccel
makepkg -si
```

Run `modprobe maccel` after installing.

Optionally, add `modprobe_on_install=true` to your dkms
config file (usually located at /etc/dkms/framework.conf) to automatically modprobe after installing
a dkms module.

#### Post-install recommendation

Optionally, add yourself to the maccel group using `usermod -aG maccel $USER` after installing, 
if you want to run `maccel` without running as root.

## Uninstall

```sh
sh /opt/maccel/uninstall.sh
```

## CLI Usage

```
CLI to control the parameters for the maccel driver

Usage: maccel [COMMAND]

Commands:
  tui         Open the Terminal UI to manage the parameters and see a graph of the sensitivity
  set         Set the value for a parameter of the maccel driver
  get         Get the values for parameters of the maccel driver
  completion  Generate a completions file for a specified shell
  help        Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Options:
  -h, --help     Print help
  -V, --version  Print version
```

## Notes

One should disable the acceleration done by default in some distros, e.g. by `xset` or `libinput`.

## Troubleshooting Install

### linux headers

You want to make sure that `/lib/modules/` is not empty. For example mine looks like this:

```
total 0
drwxr-xr-x 1 root root    114 Jan 29 17:59 .
drwxr-xr-x 1 root root 159552 Jan 29 22:39 ..
drwxr-xr-x 1 root root     10 Jan 29 17:59 6.6.14-1-lts
drwxr-xr-x 1 root root     12 Jan 29 17:59 6.7.0-zen3-1-zen
drwxr-xr-x 1 root root    494 Jan 29 17:59 6.7.2-arch1-1
drwxr-xr-x 1 root root    494 Jan 31 21:54 6.7.2-zen1-1-zen
```

You want to find headers that match your kernel as represented by

```
uname -r
```

On an arch based distro you search for the available headers with

```
pacman -Ss linux headers
```

### gcc

The version matters, it must match the version with which the kernel was built.

For example you might encounter such an error:

![image](https://github.com/Gnarus-G/maccel/assets/37311893/6147e20a-a132-4132-a45e-2af3dc035552)

And you'll have to find a version of `gcc` that matches. This will be more or less annoying
depending on your distro and/or how familiar you are with it.

### Miscellaneous

If you notice any weird behavior and are looking to investigate it,            
then try a debug build of the driver. Run this modified install command.       
                                                                               
```sh                                                                          
curl -fsSL https://www.maccel.org/install.sh | sudo DEBUG=1 sh  
```                                                                            
Watch the extra log messages flowing though:

```sh
dmesg -w
```

This debugging experience might be lacking still. Feel free to report any issue
